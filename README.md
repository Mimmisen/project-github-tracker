# GitHub Tracker

This week, we have created a place to keep track of the GitHub repos that we are crating at Technigo. We have continued practicing on JavaScript and API.
ðŸ”µ Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)
Your page should include:

A list of all repos that are forked from Technigo, Your username and profile picture,
Most recent update (push) for each repo, Name of your default branch for each repo,
URL to the actual GitHub repo, Number of commits for each repo,
It should be responsive (mobile first),A visualisation, for example through a pie chart, of how many projects you've done so far, compared to how many you will do (in total it will be 19 weekly projects ðŸ¥³) using [Chart.js]

## The problem

Process
designed page using figma
Fetched data from API and displayed it to fulfill the requirements.
Created a chart for the progress.
Styled the page.

This has been a hard project to finish with a lot of problems a long the way. How to fetches within fetches, create a chart and a token have all been new things
to learn this week.  
I always like to do some research before I start with a new project to get inspiration and a better understand for how to create what I'm building. I like to look
at other peoples code to get better knowledge of what I will do and truly understand what I'm going to build.
I have looked for solutions on stackoverflow, townhall and the help chanel. Me and my team have also meet up during the week and helped each other with
problems.

If I had more time I would add more information about every repo: languages used for the project, review comments and link to netlify.
